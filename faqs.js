        question: 'I mentioned @this_vid in a reply but I didn\'t get a response. 😕',
        answer: "We're sorry! Twitter only allows us to post 300 tweets every 3 hours, so we can't reply to every request. But your download will still be processed! You can check for it at download-this.video/your-Twitter-handle. For instance, if your twitter handle is @jack, your downloads will be at download-this.video/jack. To make things easier, you can bookmark the link in your browser.😅"
